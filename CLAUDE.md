## Project

**Name:** django-traceid
**Stack:** Python 3.12–3.14 · Django library (zero runtime dependency beyond Django; `rq` optional)
**Purpose:** End-to-end trace / request-id propagation for Django — project-agnostic, zero-config,
no monkey-patching. Every log line emitted while handling a request carries the same `trace_id`
(HTTP → services → ORM → background jobs → pub/sub), retraceable with one query in Loki/Kibana/Sentry.

## Layout

`src/` layout, package `src/django_traceid/` (~190 statements of runtime code, 6 moving parts):

```
src/django_traceid/
  middleware.py  # extracts/generates X-Request-ID, sets it in context, echoes on response
                 # (sync + async capable; keeps the id bound through streaming bodies)
  context.py     # contextvar holding the current trace_id
  filters.py     # logging filter that injects trace_id into every record
  conf.py        # settings surface (header name, propagation toggles)
  apps.py        # AppConfig wiring
  rq.py          # optional: trace_id propagation across RQ/Celery/thread boundaries
tests/           # pytest-django suite
```

## Conventions

- Branches: `feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `docs/`. Default branch: `main`.
- Supports Python 3.12+ (library); CI tests on 3.14. `requires-python` floor is intentional.
- `mypy --strict` clean · full type annotations on the public API.

## Setup

```bash
make install      # install dev deps + pre-commit
make lint         # ruff
make typecheck    # mypy
make test         # unit tests
make test-cov     # tests + coverage
make build        # build wheel
```

All checks run via `make` or `pre-commit` only — never invoke linters/tests directly on the host.

## CI

- Runs on push to `main` and on PRs (Python 3.14). CI must pass before merging.
- SonarCloud analysis configured in CI.

## graphify

This project has a knowledge graph at graphify-out/ with god nodes, community structure, and cross-file relationships.

Rules:
- For codebase questions, first run `graphify query "<question>"` when graphify-out/graph.json exists. Use `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"` for relationships and `graphify explain "<concept>"` for focused concepts. These return a scoped subgraph, usually much smaller than GRAPH_REPORT.md or raw grep output.
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, use it for broad navigation instead of raw source browsing.
- Read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md only for broad architecture review or when query/path/explain do not surface enough context.
- After modifying code, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost).

# chrysa — Transverse Standards (core)

> The **slim always-on core**. The canonical, tool-agnostic source of truth is `standards/STANDARDS.chrysa.md`; the normative annexes live under `standards/annexes/`. Each rule below is a one-line pointer — its full text lives in the per-domain file named beside the heading (`standards/rules/<domain>.md`), read on demand.

**Where an annexe and the canon disagree, the canon wins.**

### Governance, language & compliance · `standards/rules/governance.md`
- Normative annexes
- Language
- Compliance targets
- Governance — strategic pillars & ADR format

### Cross-cutting stack · `standards/rules/stack.md`
- Cross-cutting stack (settled ADRs — do not relitigate)

### SCM — branches, commits & pull requests · `standards/rules/scm.md`
- Commits
- Branches
- Branch model — `main` is production, `develop` is the workspace
- Merge
- One PR per issue
- Issues and PRs are type-driven

### Architecture, decoupling & portability · `standards/rules/architecture.md`
- Repo provenance — every code repo depends on `project-init`
- Every repo declares its profile and DDD level
- Projects talk through versioned contracts only
- Everything is machine-agnostic and portable — no rule, repo, or script is bound to one machine
- Every external server the service talks to is addressed through the environment — never hardcoded
- Every tracked file and folder must earn its place — a repo holds only what is useful to it now
- The repository architecture is legible to an agent — optimised for Claude, not only for humans
- Deferred work is a governed job, not a fire-and-forget

### Testing · `standards/rules/testing.md`
- Tests: pytest only
- Frontend tests: Vitest + Testing Library + MSW — from the scaffold, not later

### Frontend & web semantics · `standards/rules/frontend.md`
- TypeScript is strict by contract
- The JS/TS package manager is `pnpm` — `npm` and `yarn` are forbidden
- React is a presentation layer, not the domain
- The frontend says when the backend is unreachable or unstable
- The frontend is reactive and real-time by default
- UI state survives reload & focus
- Everything is semantic — the markup, the data, and the URLs
- URL-addressable frontend navigation — mandatory

### APIs, contracts & real-time · `standards/rules/api.md`
- A real-time backend has channel contracts and never blocks
- APIs, SDKs & public contracts follow the `STD-API-001` contract

### Accessibility · `standards/rules/accessibility.md`
- Dark mode
- Every site is usable by the majority of disabilities — not only the screen-reader case

### Documentation & session state · `standards/rules/docs.md`
- Notion logging
- Documentation and Notion are maintained in lockstep with the code — a change that leaves them stale is unfinished
- Session lifecycle (primer + memory + hindsight)

### AI agents & features · `standards/rules/agents.md`
- Agent actions are governed
- An AI feature is evaluated, not just shipped
- An agent writes only where the owner owns

### Security, identity & sessions · `standards/rules/security.md`
- Per-person data implies a user account — no exceptions dressed up as simplicity
- Identity goes through the cluster SSO first
- A session is secured and it expires
- Every form is a hostile input surface — validate on the server, always

### Code quality & anti-patterns · `standards/rules/code-quality.md`
- No hardcoded constants
- No literal HTTP status codes — use the constants the framework already ships
- No code duplication — the second occurrence is an extraction order
- Raised errors are typed
- Failures are contained, and observable
- Prefer a lookup table to a state machine
- Decompose into small, independently unit-testable methods
- Code is read far more often than it is written — optimise for the reader, and standardise the form
- Avoid lambdas and anonymous constructs — a named function is the default
- Basic optimisations and known anti-patterns are caught in review and in CI
- A cache is a correctness contract, not a sprinkle of speed
- Quality gates
- Error handling pattern (all automations)

### Backend Python · `standards/rules/backend-python.md`
- Python packaging — `pyproject.toml` is the single source of truth
- Python is written object-oriented, one class per file
- Import the item, not the module — `from x import y; y()`
- Functions and methods are called with named arguments — positional call sites are the exception, not the rule

### Data, persistence & migrations · `standards/rules/data.md`
- Data, persistence & migrations follow the `STD-DATA-001` contract

### Observability & operations · `standards/rules/observability.md`
- Observability & production readiness follow the `STD-OPS-001` contract
- The container is versioned separately from the application it hosts, and an admin can see what is actually deployed
- Observability — error-tracking → GitHub issues (norm)

### Containers & compose · `standards/rules/containers.md`
- Everything runs in a container — the only exception is the slice of a repo genuinely bound to the host OS
- External dependencies are installed in containers, never on the host
- No virtualenv in a repo — ever
- Tool caches & deps never touch the project tree
- Dockerfiles are multi-stage, with a `production` and a `dev` stage — mandatory
- App containers ship the app only — the platform layer is the owner's responsibility
- Only a publicly useful port is published — everything else stays on the container network
- A compose file is minimal — declare only what the stack needs, default the rest
- Dev stage must hot-reload
- Local dev runs the code in-container, live, in debug mode — never the production server
- `.dockerignore` mandatory & exhaustive
- Container-runtime policy

### Product surfaces · `standards/rules/product.md`
- Setup wizard & config panel
- A game is DRM-free and fully playable solo offline
- Every product that is operated ships a management backoffice
- If a user can supply a file, the product accepts an upload
- A floating assistant where it earns its place — never as decoration

### Design system · `standards/rules/design.md`
- Design system

### Developer loop & tooling · `standards/rules/dev-loop.md`
- Makefile targets
- Shared skills (load on demand from shared-standards/.claude/skills/)

### CI/CD, pre-commit & release · `standards/rules/ci-cd.md`
- Release & changelog config (canonical)
- GitHub Actions (reuse first · custom actions centralised · thin workflows)
- Pre-commit & git hooks (native, via pre-commit.com — never wrapped in make)
